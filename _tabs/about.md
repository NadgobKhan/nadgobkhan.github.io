## Who am I

Hi there! I'm Bogdan, a security researcher and Application Security Engineer from Romania, specializing in offensive security and web application penetration testing. I'm passionate about identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities across complex modern applications and cloud-native environments.

I'm an active bug bounty hunter on HackerOne and CTF competitor, continuously refining my offensive security skills. I view this craft like a mythical blacksmith—the more dedication poured into it, the better the results. My career is built on a foundation of reverse engineering, malware analysis, and software vulnerability research.

**Current Focus:**
- 🔍 Web application penetration testing & API security
- 🔐 CI/CD pipeline security & supply chain protection
- ☁️ Cloud security & cloud-native pentesting
- 📚 Working toward CCSP & GCPN certifications

In my free time, I enjoy combat sports, traveling, and creating music. Welcome to my blog!

## Professional Summary

I currently work as an Application Security Engineer specializing in web application penetration testing. My role centers on identifying, exploiting, and helping remediate security weaknesses across complex applications and cloud-native environments. I work closely with engineering teams to strengthen security posture throughout the SDLC.

I have hands-on experience securing CI/CD pipelines, focusing on code and open-source dependency vulnerabilities using tools such as Snyk, and secret detection and governance using Cycode. My work enables developers to integrate secure practices early, maintain clean pipelines, and reduce security risks before they reach production.

My career path is firmly rooted in offensive security. I actively refine my skills through continuous learning, industry conferences, and advanced training. I currently hold CISSP and GWAPT (GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester) certifications and am working toward CCSP and GCPN (GIAC Cloud Penetration Tester) to deepen my cloud security and cloud pentesting expertise.

Before transitioning into application security, I began my career at Avira (now Gen) in 2018. Initially joining as an intern, I later moved into a Threat Researcher role, where I focused on malware analysis, reverse engineering, and detection engineering. I developed internal tools for analyzing malicious files—including a static analysis tool for identifying information leaks in Android applications—and contributed to research, threat hunting, and technical writing.

This foundation in reverse engineering, malware research, and software vulnerabilities continues to shape my approach as I grow in offensive security. My long-term goal is to become a highly skilled ethical hacker, constantly improving, learning, and enjoying the craft.
